       <h1>Interesting facts about Egypt</h1>
       <img src="egypt1.jpeg" alt="" />
       <p>1. The country is ethnically homogeneous, with Egyptians comprising more than 99% of the population.

2. The country's population is estimated to be 90% Muslim (primarily Sunni) and various Christian denominations make up the remaining 10%.

3. Cairo has served as Egypt's capital for more than 1,000 years, but the government is building a new capital some 45 kilometers (28 miles) to the east to help ease congestion in Cairo. Plans call for the yet-to-be-named city to host the main government departments and ministries, as well as foreign embassies.

4. One of the most famous figures tied to Egypt, Cleopatra VII, was Greek.

5. Ancient Egypt produced one of history's earliest peace treaties, the Kadesh Peace Treaty, negotiated in 1259 B.C. with the Hittite Empire. In 1970 the government of Turkey gave a copy of the treaty to the United Nations, where it can be seen at the entrance of the Security Council chambers.

6. Egypt is home to seven UNESCO-designated World Heritage sites: Abu Mena; ancient Thebes with its Necropolis; Historic Cairo; Memphis and its Necropolis; Nubian monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae; the Saint Catherine area; and Wadi Al-Hitan, or Whale Valley, home to fossil remains of the earliest and now extinct form of whales.


7. Various international rights groups, including Amnesty International, Freedom House and Human Rights Watch, criticize the country for low levels of personal freedom and the arrests and jailing of peaceful activists who are critical of the government.

8. Social media accounts with more than 5,000 followers are subject to the country's media laws and can be monitored by authorities and must be licensed by the government.

9. Ancient Egypt produced the world's first prosthetic limb, a toe composed of leather, wood and thread and dated between 950 and 710 B.C.

10. The 365-day calendar that is divided into 12 months was invented in Egypt.</p>

    <div class="desc"><p>The Great Pyramid of Giza is the biggest Egyptian pyramid and the tomb of Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu. Built in the early 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. As part of the Giza pyramid complex, it borders present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. They perfectly line up with orion's belt. It's still a mystery today about how they were built.</p>

    <div class="desc"><p>Abu Simbel is one of the famous landmarks of Egypt and also an ancient complex temple comprising of two temples constructed during the reign of Ramesses II.The two massive rock temples serve as lasting monuments to the king and his queen.

The bigger temple (which stands at 98 feet(30 meters) high and 115 feet (35 meters) long) represents King Ramesses and the smaller temple (which stands at 40 feet (12 meters) high and 92 feet (28 meters) long) represents his queen Nefertari.

The front entrance of the great temple is adorned with four seated colossi – 2 at each side showing Ramesses II on his throne.And what makes the temple more interesting are the engravings on the interior walls that depict Ramesses and Nefertari making sacrifices to the gods.

Abu Simbel is located on the western bank of Lake Nasser in a small village of Nubia about 230km southwest of Aswan.

It costs 400 EGP to be granted access to both of the Abu Simbel temples.</p>

    <div class="desc"><p>The tomb of Tutankhamun, also known by its tomb number, KV62, is the burial place of Tutankhamun (reigned c. 1334–1325 BC), a pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of ancient Egypt, in the Valley of the Kings. The tomb consists of four chambers and an entrance staircase and corridor. It is smaller and less extensively decorated than other Egyptian royal tombs of its time, and it probably originated as a tomb for a non-royal individual that was adapted for Tutankhamun's use after his premature death. Like other pharaohs, Tutankhamun was buried with a wide variety of funerary objects and personal possessions, such as coffins, furniture, clothing and jewellery, though in the unusually limited space these goods had to be densely packed.</p>

        <h1>Alien Existence</h1>
    
   The biggest argument given by ancient alien theorists is that ancient humans simply weren't advanced enough to create such magnificent wonders as the Giza pyramids. They find it incomprehensible that ancient people understood mathematics and astronomy well enough to build them. Their only conclusion is that without advanced mathematical abilities, the ancient Egyptians couldn't have built these mathematically precise structures.

They claim proof in the oldest written record of mathematical knowledge found in the Sumerian culture (1822-1784 BC), and this text demonstrates the ancients didn't have the complex mathematical knowledge required to build the pyramids. Even the Babylonian tablets (2000 BC) reveal the limits of ancient math since the tablets contain the ancients' unsuccessful attempts to resolve complex mathematical problems like cubic equations.
One excellent example of the math and constellation behind the pyramids is presented by RG "Robert" Bauval, who put forth the Orion Correlation Theory. According to the theory, the alignment of the three pyramids of Giza match constellations. Bauval hypothesized that the ancient Egyptians planned the three pyramids to match the Belt of Orion configuration of three stars, Zeta, Epsilon, and Delta Orionis, within the Orion constellation.
